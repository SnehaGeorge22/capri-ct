## Data preprocessing is the process of transforming raw data into a clean and structured format that can be effectively used for analysis or machine learning tasks. It is a critical step in any data science or medical imaging pipeline, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare and radiology, where data quality directly affects model reliability.
