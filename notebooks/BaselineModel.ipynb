    "The non-causal baseline model is used as a reference point to compare against the causal-aware Capri-CT model. Unlike Capri-CT, which integrates causal reasoning to understand how interventions affect outcomes, the baseline model relies solely on correlational patterns in the data without explicitly modeling causal relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "This baseline typically consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) that processes image data alongside metadata inputs such as voltage, time, and agent type. It predicts outcomes like Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) based on observed features, without accounting for causal interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "While effective at capturing associations, the non-causal baseline lacks robustness to changes caused by interventions or shifts in the data distribution. Therefore, it provides a meaningful benchmark to demonstrate the advantages of causal-aware models like Capri-CT in terms of interpretability, generalization, and handling of counterfactual scenarios.\n"
